## [About our product]()

## How we built it
Our project contains frontend, and backend components. The breakdown for each component is as follows:

Backend CNN Model - We employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object detection, enabling accurate identification and similarity calculations between lost and found paws. 
Flask - Flask served as the backbone of our backend infrastructure, facilitating HTTP request handling, routing, and communication with the frontend. 
AWS S3 - AWS S3 was utilised for database management and secure cloud storage of images.
The Request library was utilised for making HTTP requests to external APIs, enabling communication with third-party services and data retrieval. 
Flask mail -  We implement Flask Mail for automated notifications and updates, ensuring timely alerts for users. 
Jinja language -The Jinja templating engine helps us dynamically display database-driven content on the website.

Frontend HTML,CSS were chosen for frontend development. We have used Boostrap framework which provides a robust and efficient framework for building interactive user interfaces. In additional, our frontend also created the new style to make user interface look fanstastic. The frontend displays the paw images, with having high similarities rate, to the client so they can have more opportunities to identify their paw.
